that is an awesome idea! In fact, I know that Deborah's project at the Berman is hoping to involve 3-D visualization. 





I would also reach out to Carlita Favero-- I know she was having Dom Monte in Communications do some video work with her on her lab research, but it could be awesome to have some animation involved.
